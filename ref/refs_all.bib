  abstract      = {A key challenge towards future quantum internet technology is connecting quantum processors at metropolitan scale. Here, we report on heralded entanglement between two independently operated quantum network nodes separated by 10km. The two nodes hosting diamond spin qubits are linked with a midpoint station via 25km of deployed optical fiber. We minimize the effects of fiber photon loss by quantum frequency conversion of the qubit-native photons to the telecom L-band and by embedding the link in an extensible phase-stabilized architecture enabling the use of the loss-resilient single-photon entangling protocol. By capitalizing on the full heralding capabilities of the network link in combination with real-time feedback logic on the long-lived qubits, we demonstrate the delivery of a predefined entangled state on the nodes irrespective of the heralding detection pattern. Addressing key scaling challenges and being compatible with different qubit systems, our architecture establishes a generic platform for exploring metropolitan-scale quantum networks.},

  abstract      = {The coherent control of the orbital state is crucial for color centers in diamonds for realizing extremely low-power manipulation. Here, we propose the neutrally charged nitrogen-vacancy center, NV$^0$, as an ideal system for orbital control through electric fields. We estimate electric susceptibility in the ground state of NV$^0$ to be comparable to that in the excited state of NV$^-$. Also, we demonstrate coherent control of the orbital states of NV$^0$. The required power for orbital control is three orders of magnitude smaller than that for spin control, highlighting the potential for interfacing a superconducting qubit operated in a dilution refrigerator.},
